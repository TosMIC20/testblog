# Basic Ideas of Classical Thermodynamics  
  
## Terminology:  
  
### Thermal system:   
  
A physical system in whose temperature-dependent properties we are interested.  
  
### Thermal equilibrium:   
  
A thermal state for which the temperature & all the temperature-dependent properties do not change.  
A system in such state can be characterized by its temperature.  
  
### Thermal reservoir (heat bath):   
  
A large thermal system that maintains its temperature when it interacts with other thermal systems.   
  
### Thermal contact:   
  
Systems reach thermal equilibrium through thermal contacts, such as radiation, convection & conduction.  
  
### Thermally-isolated system:   
  
A system not in thermal contact with its surroundings.  
  
## Temperature:  
  
### Definition:  
  
In classical thermodynamics the definition of temperature is very zannen「残念」:  
  
> ***Temperature*** is a physical quantity measured by a thermometer.  
  
Then what is a thermometer?  
  
> ***Thermometers*** are devices that measure the temperature of a thermal system quantitatively, typically by coming into thermal equilibrium with that system.  
  
It's just bullshit. But defining temperature is not an easy job. Although there have been more acceptable definitions, physicists are still looking for better ones. A wide accepted definition of temperature is given in statistical mechanics, which is known as $\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}$ . It is usually  described as a *measure of average kinetic energy of molecules*.   
  
But in classical thermodynamics, though not well defined, temperature is just what we expect it to be in life: the measure of coldness or hotness of substance. Actually, what classical thermodynamics contribute to the idea of temperature most is temperature scales.  
  
### Temperature scales:  
  
The review of this part history can be too long. Here we just introduce the *Kelvin temperature scale*. Basically, what a temperature scale does is to establish a **linear** standard for temperature. In order to establish such a standard, we need to define two temperatures.  
  
In the case of Kelvin temperature scale, we define $T=0$ as the point where $P=0$ with $V,n$ fixed. This was based on the experimental fact that $T\propto \frac{PV}{n}+C$. Another point is chosen to be the triple point of water, $T=273.16K$. The reason to pick $273.16$ is simply to agree with Celsius scale.   
  
  
  
  
## Ideal Gas  
  
### Ideal gas law:  
  
### Equation of state:  
  
Here comes the famous (or infamous if you write the symbols in certain order) equation:  
  
> $$\tag{1}PV=nRT$$  
  
This equation comes from a series of experimental fact, and works well with some real gas under some conditions. Notice that we are not introducing the concept of *ideal gas*, because in classical thermodynamics,   
  
### Ideal gas:  
  
In classical thermodynamics, we can only define ideal gas as follows:  
  
> ***Ideal gas*** is a theoretical gas that obeys the equation of state $(1)$.  
  
Wait, but we learned in high school that ideal gas is a theoretical gas that satisfies:  
  
1. Particles have zero volume.  
2. There are no interparticle interactions.  
3. All collisions are elastic.  
  
But this is actually statistical mechanics, so again, since here we are only talking about classical thermodynamics, we have to accept that.
