# Postscript  
  
This is probably the end of thermodynamics lifesaver series. It is just a part of notes of University Physics B. Most definitions are copied from textbook: *Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics, Third Edition*, and from lecture slides.   
  
I came up with some of the proofs myself and didn't check them with major ideas in modern physics, so there are probably mistakes in them. After all, I do not major nor minor in physics.  
  
There should have been more on statistical mechanics in order to better understand entropy, but the course doesn't cover that (actually mentions a little, but not better than none).  
  
If you find the series helpful, thank you for sparing time reading it. If you find any mistake, you can contact me or post issue at github repo of this blog site.
