# The 1st Law of Thermodynamics  
  
## 1st law  
  
*The 1st law of thermodynamics* is a statement of the **conservation of energy** for thermal systems.   
  
*It's based on empirical fact that heat flow and work are equivalent ways of changing the internal energy.*   
  
The 1st law states that for any thermal process:  
  
> $$\Delta U=Q-W,$$  
  
or differential form:  
  
> $$dU=dQ-dW.$$   
  
Actually using $dQ$ and $dW$ is not accurate, because they are path dependent. For convenience we just write them like those, but keep in mind that they are only **differential forms**.
