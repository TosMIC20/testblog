# Electrostatic Equilibrium  
  
## Equilibrium  
  
When an charge system is at equilibrium, its charge distribution will not change. According to this condition, we can arrive at some conclusions of conductors at electrostatic equilibrium.  
  
## Conductors  
  
At electrostatic equilibrium,   
  
- conductors have **no** internal static electric field, that is, $\vec{E}\equiv \mathbf{0}$ inside conductors.  
  
This is easy to understand, otherwise the free charges inside will move, contradictory to equilibrium.  
  
- If there's no non-conducting material inside a conductor, all its charge is on its outside surface.   
  
If there's charge inside, use Gauss' law, and you will find that there are electric field near the charge.  
  
- The electric field near the outside surface of a conductor is **perpendicular** to the conductor's surface.  
  
If there's non zero parallel component, then the charges on the surface will move, contradictory to equilibrium. This immediately gives that near the surface,  
$$  
E=\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}.  
$$  
The space inside a conductor has $\vec{E}=0$ at equilibrium, and the fact is that an electrostatic equilibrium forms very fast, so a hollow conductor can protect the inside from outside electric field, which is called *electro shielding*.
