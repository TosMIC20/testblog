# Preface  
  
Electromagnetism covers a lot of materials. There are so many formulas, which are either hard to remember or easy to confuse. Besides, there are a lot techniques in calculation.   
  
The *Electromagnetism Lifesaver* series is aimed to illustrate a clearer outline of Laws and conclusions in Electromagnetism, but leaves out on the nature, or the whys in it.   
  
So this series will be richer in equations and derivations than in descriptions.

# Magnetism  
  
Before the magnetism section, there should have been some materials on DC. However, there's nothing new in this part compared with high school physics. So, let's just ignore it, and dive into magnetism.
